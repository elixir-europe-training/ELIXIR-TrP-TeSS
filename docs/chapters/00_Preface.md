# Protocols for efficient use of TeSS

Hello and welcome, this is our interactive hands-on course about efficient use of the ELIXIR TeSS platform.

> We are using the interactive Open Educational Resource online/offline course infrastructure called LiaScript. 
> It is a distributed way of creating and sharing educational content hosted on github.

To prepare this training material, we have reused the content of the publication 'Making Bioinformatics Training Events and Material More Discoverable Using TeSS, the ELIXIR Training Portal' published in Current Protocols in Bioinformatics. The original publication of the protocols can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpz1.682).

*About ELIXIR Training Platform*

The ELIXIR Training Platform was established to develop a training community that spans all ELIXIR member states (see the list of Training Coordinators). It aims to strengthen national training programmes, grow bioinformatics training capacity and competence across Europe, and empower researchers to use ELIXIR's services and tools. 

One service offered by the Training Platform is TeSS, the training registry for the ELIXIR community. Together with ELIXIR France and ELIXIR Slovenia, VIB as lead node for ELIXIR Belgium is engaged in consolidating quality and impact of the TeSS training resources (2022-23) (https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/2022-trp3).

The Training eSupport System was developed to help trainees, trainers and their institutions to have a one-stop shop where they can share and find information about training and events, including training material. This way we can create a catalogue that can be shared within the community. How it works is what we are going to find out in this course.

*About VIB and VIB Technologies*

VIB is an entrepreneurial non-profit research institute, with a clear focus on groundbreaking strategic basic research in life sciences and operates in close partnership with the five universities in Flanders – Ghent University, KU Leuven, University of Antwerp, Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Hasselt University.

As part of the VIB Technologies, the 12 VIB Core Facilities, provide support in a wide array of research fields and housing specialized scientific equipment for each discipline. Science and technology go hand in hand. New technologies advance science and often accelerate breakthroughs in scientific research. VIB has a visionary approach to science and technology, founded on its ability to identify and foster new innovations in life sciences.

The goal of VIB Technology Training is to up-skill life scientists to excel in the domains of VIB Technologies, Bioinformatics & AI, Software Development, and Research Data Management.

## Introduction


Many trainers and their organisations are passionate about sharing their training material. Sharing training material has several benefits like providing a record of recognition as an author, offering inspiration to other trainers, enabling researchers to discover training resources for their personal learning path, and facilitating to complement the training resource landscape by data-driven gap analysis from the bioinformatics community (see [PLOS Computational Biology, 16(5), e1007854](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854)).

In this tutorial, we elaborate a series of protocols leading the TeSS users through the process of searching and filtering TeSS content (Scenario 1 to 3). Scenario 4 to 7 show how to register manually and automatically training events and material in the [Training eSupport System (TeSS), ELIXIR’s training portal](https://tess.elixir-europe.org). More information about TeSS can be found in [this publication](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa047). 

TeSS provides a one-stop shop for trainers and trainees to discover online information and content, including training materials, events and interactive tutorials. Following these protocols, you will contribute to promote your training events and add to a growing catalog of materials. This will concomitantly increase the FAIRness of training materials and events.

Training registries like TeSS use a scraping mechanism to aggregate training resources from many providers when they have been annotated using training specific [BioSchemas specifications](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.24.516513). Protocol 8 will teach you how to enrich your training resources to allow for more efficient sharing of the structured metadata like prerequisites, target audience, and learning outcomes using Bioschemas specification. Once more and more training events and material are aggregated in TeSS, searching the registry for specific events and material becomes crucial.
