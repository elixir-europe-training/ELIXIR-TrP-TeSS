<h2 id="scenario-4-registration-of-a-content-provider-in-tess">Scenario 4: Registration of a content provider in TeSS</h2>
<p>Training resources (events and materials) may be added to TeSS to reach bigger audiences, increase impact and bolster event attendance. Registering events and training materials makes them more findable in a variety of ways to various user bases. TeSS features content providers which are entities (such as academic institutions, non-profit organisations, portals etc.) that provide training materials of relevance to life sciences and ELIXIR. In order to have a training event automatically harvested in TeSS, as described in <a href="#9">Scenario 8</a>, a content provider has to be registered first. It also adds visibility to content providers. Here is the procedure to register a new content provider in TeSS.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Login to TeSS at https://tess.elixir-europe.org following <a href="#4">Scenario 4</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To register a content provider, click on the Providers menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on “+ Register content provider”. You will be directed to a form type of page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an example, we will create the content provider NanoCommons. Enter “NanoCommons“ in the Title field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the URL field, enter the URL of the content provider, which is “https://www.nanocommons.eu/” in our example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter “Jean Dupont” as a contact person in the Contact field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the subsequent field Description, provide general information and relevant context about the content provider in the form of short text.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This field supports markdown syntax.</p>
<p>Here is one example: “NanoCommons will deliver a sustainable and openly accessible nanoinformatics framework (knowledgebase and integrated computational tools, supported by expert advice, data interpretation and training), for assessment of the risks of NMs, their products and their formulations. NanoCommons combines Joint Research Activities to implement the nanoinformatics Knowledge Commons, Networking Activities to facilitate engagement with the research community, industry and regulators, and provision of funded Access to the nanoinformatics tools via funded calls for Transnational Access.”</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Enter a image to have a <strong>visual representation of the content provider</strong>. The image can be added by URL of the image location or by uploading an image.</li>

<li>
<p>Confirm the creation of the content provider by clicking on ‘Register content provider’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="scenario-5-manual-registration-of-a-training-event-in-tess">Scenario 5: Manual registration of a training event in TeSS</h2>
<p>A training event in TeSS is described by the BioSchemas profile CourseInstance, while the schema.org Event profile is something different. So, let’s start this session pointing out a few differences of each profile:</p>
<p>An unique event such as a congress, symposium, webinar will be classified using the Event profile in Schemas.org, while the Bioschemas Course profile is attached to a unit of teaching that typically lasts one or more academic terms, is led by one or more instructors (teachers or professors), and has a fixed roster of students. A course usually covers an individual subject. Such a course will be linked to several course instances that happen at different moments, locations and might be also subjected to updates and small differences in the material. A course and/or course instance should be linked to a course material, that represents the content of this course/course instance. In TeSS, though, courses and courses instances are in called Event in the interface, while this is not the same as the profile in schemas.org. It works to filter among all courses, webinars, symposia, congresses etc.</p>
<p>Such an event in TeSS is a link to a single training event sourced by a provider along with description and related meta information (e.g. date, location, audience, ontological categorization, keywords, etc.). </p>
<p>Training events in TeSS can be added manually or automatically harvested from a provider’s website. Here is the procedure to register for training events manually.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot for login page" src="../../assets/images/rhh0rv5.png"></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Login to TeSS at https://tess.elixir-europe.org as outlined above in Scenario 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To register for a training event, click on the Events menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on “+ Register event”. As an example, we use an RNAseq training event.
You will be directed to a form type of page. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="screenshot for login page" src="https://github.com/elixir-europe-training/ELIXIR-TrP-TeSS/blob/main/docs/assets/images/appDpje.png"></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Select that Type at the beginning of the form since we enter a face-to-face event.
If your event is online, choosing the option “Online” which will modify the form to fit that type of event i.e. no address field has to be filled in. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Title field, enter the Title of the event, which is “Bulk RNASeq: from counts to differential expression” in our example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The optional Subtitle field can be filled in case you’d like to specify more context on the event, like “Spring edition” of a regularly repeated course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the URL field, enter the URL where the announcement and registration of the training event can be found. In our example: “https://training.vib.be/all-trainings/bulk-rnaseq-counts-differential-expression-2”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the subsequent field Description, provide general information and relevant context about the training event in the form of short text, like in our example: “The course consists of introductory online material on producing count matrices and two face-to-face sessions on differential expression analysis in R and all the questions that arise when trying the analysis on your own data.”
This field supports markdown syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>In the field Prerequisites, enter which prerequisites are necessary to follow the training event. For example, write “Background knowledge of NGS data formats and the first steps in the analysis workflow (fastqc -&gt; bam files). If you are a newbie in the field, you have to follow the NGS introduction training first. Experience in R programming is highly recommended. If you never worked with R, you should attend the R introduction training first.” This field supports markdown syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the field Learning objectives, list the learning objectives of the training event like 
○   Learn how RNA-seq reads are converted into counts
